Show 100 either avlonia's or bevlonia's, with them having to decide which is which.

1) Fetch from server what the category I am learning is, and what the foil category is.
This needs to not be random but chosen so that pairs of subjects see the same categories
as each other but learn a different one (swaps foil and target category). Foil category
is always a different feature.

2) Half of them have to have the target feature and half also have to the foil feature,
with half overlap. So 25 avolnia, 25 bev., 25 both, 25 neither.

3) Break to explain instructions.

4) Again generate 25 of each overlap, this time for the person to study for 3s/item.

5) Then memory test. 80 old items, 20 of each kind. 90 new items: 30 avlonias, 30
bevlonias, 30 of neither.

<p>This HIT will involve 3 short tasks, all involving pictures of flowers. It should take approximately 12-15 minutes to do all 3 tasks.</p>
<p>During the first task, you will see one flower at a time and have to determine whether or not it is an <b>avlonia</b>. Avlonias are a particular species of flower. They are different from all other flowers in one simple way -- and your job is to find out what that is. For example, it could be that avlonias all have 4 petals, but no other flowers do. Or avlonias could be the only flowers that have a pink center; or a round petal shape; or a heart in their center.</p>

<p>As you can see from these examples, the flowers in this experiment will differ in a number of ways: (1) the number of petals, (2) the color of the petals, (3) the shape of the petals, (4) the shape of their center, (5) the color of their center, (6) the shape of the hole inside their center, and (7) the number of sepals (the black ovals between the petals). One of these features will determine what is and is not an avlonia.</p>
<p>In the first task, you'll be shown a single flower, and then be asked if it is or not an avlonia (press 'y' if yes, 'n' if no). At first, you'll have to guess. Eventually, though, you'll figure out what makes something an avlonia. You will have <span id="numLearning">0</span> flowers to judge. Do your best to determine what makes something an avlonia.</p><br>

<p>Great job!</p>
<p>During the second task, you will have to remember flowers. You'll be shown <span id="numStudy">0</span> flowers, one at a time, for just a few seconds each. Do your best to remember these flowers as well as you can. If you remember a large number of them successfully, you'll likely get bonus pay.
<p>Some of the flowers you have to remember might be avlonias and some might not.</p>

<p>Great job!</p>
<p>During the third and final task, you will have to say which flowers you saw in the previous part and which you didn't. You'll be shown <span id="numTest">0</span> flowers, one at a time. Some you will have seen before, and some you won't have seen. For each flower, you have to say whether you saw it before. If you did see it, press the 'y' key. If you didn't, press the 'n' key. Please do your best!</p>
